                        Joel S. Marcus is Executive Chairman and Founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
                        (NYSE:ARE), the urban office REIT that pioneered life science real estate and today is the preeminent
                        and longest-tenured owner, operator, and developer uniquely focused on collaborative life science,
                        agtech, and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations. Prior to serving as the company’s
                        full-time Executive Chairman, Mr. Marcus served as Chief Executive Officer from March 1997 to April
                        2018 and as Chairman from May 2007 to April 2018. Since co-founding the company in 1994 as a garage
                        startup with $19 million in Series A capital, he led Alexandria to its inclusion as an S&amp;P 500 company,
                        which has a total enterprise value of $33 billion, ranking it among the top 10 of all equity REITs, as well as
                        a total equity capitalization of $24 billion and a total shareholder return exceeding 1,900% as of
                        December 31, 2020. Mr. Marcus continues to guide the company and be responsible for its outstanding
                        reputation in the real estate and life science industries. Alexandria was named the NAIOP 2019
                        Developer of the Year and is the five-time and current recipient of the Nareit Gold Investor CARE
                        (Communications and Reporting Excellence) Award. Mr. Marcus also established and leads Alexandria’s
                        dedicated COVID-19 Task Force and continues to spearhead the company’s comprehensive response to
                        the ongoing pandemic.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Under Mr. Marcus’s leadership and through Alexandria’s critical role at the vanguard and heart of the life
                        science and agtech ecosystems, the mission-driven company is building the future of life-changing
                        innovation and driving positive change for the benefit of society. Mr. Marcus has guided Alexandria’s
                        extraordinary growth through the tremendous execution of its visionary cluster campus strategy as
                        informed by Harvard Business Professor Michael Porter’s cluster theory. Utilizing this theory as the basis
                        for its proven cluster model that identified and brings together the four critical components necessary for
                        life science companies to thrive — location, innovation, talent, and capital — Mr. Marcus led pivotal shifts
                        from Alexandria’s original, single assets to amenitized cluster campuses to today’s mega campuses
                        consisting of more than 1 million RSF in both urban and suburban locations. Extending the company’s
                        impact beyond its essential Labspace ® real estate, Mr. Marcus established three additional and
                        complementary vertical platforms to enhance its holistic business model encompassing real estate,
                        venture investments, thought leadership, and corporate responsibility. Through the company’s
                        differentiated cluster-building approach, which leverages these cohesive platforms and its mega campus
                        strategy, Alexandria catalyzes the vibrant life science ecosystems it has created and cultivated in key
                        locations, including Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle,
                        Maryland, and Research Triangle, to accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries into new
                        treatments and cures.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        During Mr. Marcus’s 27 years at Alexandria as a pioneer, entrepreneur, executive, and venture capitalist,
                        he has helped form, build, and nurture a broad range of life science companies. Mr. Marcus founded and
                        continues to lead Alexandria Venture Investments, the company’s strategic venture capital platform.
                        Since its inception in 1996, it has invested in promising seed-, early-, and growth-stage companies and
                        been an integral component of the company’s multifaceted business model. As a testament to
                        Alexandria’s position at the cutting edge of innovation at the earliest stages, Alexandria Venture
                        Investments has been recognized by Silicon Valley Bank as the #1 most active corporate investor in
                        biopharma by new deal volume for four consecutive years and by AgFunder as one of the five most active
                        U.S. investors in agtech in 2020. With more than $1.6 billion under management, Alexandria Venture
                        Investments continues to invest in many of the most transformative companies accelerating breakthroughs in immunology, neuroscience, cell and gene therapies, single-cell genomics, epigenetics,
                        synthetic biology, in silico drug discovery, and other new areas of science. Mr. Marcus represents
                        Alexandria on the boards of the publicly traded Applied Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Frequency
                        Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:FREQ), Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITCI), and MeiraGTx
                        Holdings plc (NASDAQ:MGTX).
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        A trusted and collaborative partner within the life science industry, Mr. Marcus was one of the principal
                        architects of Kirin-Amgen, Inc., the trailblazing biotech joint venture established in 1984 to fund the global
                        development and commercialization of EPO (Epogen), and later G-CSF (Neupogen) — two blockbuster
                        recombinant DNA products that have meaningfully benefited countless chronic kidney disease and
                        cancer patients. In 2011, he co-founded Alexandria’s thought leadership vertical with its signature
                        initiative, the Alexandria Summit ® . Established to serve as a highly collaborative, neutral platform, the
                        Alexandria Summit convenes a diverse group of visionary stakeholders to explore critical fields in
                        healthcare and the crucial role of medical innovation in the advancement of human health, and leverages
                        its powerful collective voice to foster impactful collaborations and shape policy. Over the last decade, the
                        Alexandria Summit has helped stimulate novel approaches to disease that improve patient outcomes,
                        drive the discovery and development of novel and cost-effective therapies, impact policy to advance
                        innovation that saves lives and manages and cures disease, and address the urgent need to transform
                        our healthcare system.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        For Alexandria’s far-reaching social responsibility platform, Mr. Marcus has aimed to drive forward
                        disruptive and scalable solutions that address society’s most urgent and widespread challenges, including
                        the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid epidemic, homelessness crisis, hunger and food insecurity,
                        educational disparities, and climate change. Determined to reverse the trajectory of the opioid crisis, one
                        of the greatest U.S. public health crises, Mr. Marcus and Alexandria partnered with Verily to pioneer
                        OneFifteen, an innovative, non-profit evidence-based recovery ecosystem dedicated to helping people
                        live healthy, addiction-free lives. Alexandria led the design and development of OneFifteen’s fully
                        integrated campus that provides the full continuum of care with facilities and services for treatment,
                        residential housing, peer support, family reunification, workforce development, job placement, and
                        community transition. This meaningful endeavor was featured as the cover story in the January/February
                        2021 issue of REIT Magazine. He has also been deeply engaged with a number of highly impactful local
                        and national non-profit organizations for many years, serving on the board of directors of Robin Hood,
                        New York City’s largest poverty-fighting organization; the Emily Krzyzewski Center, which paves a path to
                        long-term success in higher education and beyond for academically focused, low-income K–12 students;
                        and the Navy SEAL Foundation, which provides vital support and care for the Naval Special Warfare
                        community and their families. Mr. Marcus also serves on the boards of the Foundation for the National
                        Institutes of Health (FNIH), the National Medal of Honor Museum, the Navy SEAL Foundation, the Parker
                        Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum. His significant philanthropic
                        contributions have been widely recognized, and in March 2020, Mr. Marcus and Alexandria received the
                        prestigious Navy SEAL Foundation Patriot Award for their tireless dedication to, and embodiment of, the
                        values that epitomize the SEAL community.

                        Joel S. Marcus is Executive Chairman and Founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
                        (NYSE:ARE), the urban office REIT that pioneered life science real estate and today is the preeminent
                        and longest-tenured owner, operator, and developer uniquely focused on collaborative life science,
                        agtech, and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations. Prior to serving as the company’s
                        full-time Executive Chairman, Mr. Marcus served as Chief Executive Officer from March 1997 to April
                        2018 and as Chairman from May 2007 to April 2018. Since co-founding the company in 1994 as a garage
                        startup with $19 million in Series A capital, he led Alexandria to its inclusion as an S&amp;P 500 company,
                        which has a total enterprise value of $33 billion, ranking it among the top 10 of all equity REITs, as well as
                        a total equity capitalization of $24 billion and a total shareholder return exceeding 1,900% as of
                        December 31, 2020. Mr. Marcus continues to guide the company and be responsible for its outstanding
                        reputation in the real estate and life science industries. Alexandria was named the NAIOP 2019
                        Developer of the Year and is the five-time and current recipient of the Nareit Gold Investor CARE
                        (Communications and Reporting Excellence) Award. Mr. Marcus also established and leads Alexandria’s
                        dedicated COVID-19 Task Force and continues to spearhead the company’s comprehensive response to
                        the ongoing pandemic.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Under Mr. Marcus’s leadership and through Alexandria’s critical role at the vanguard and heart of the life
                        science and agtech ecosystems, the mission-driven company is building the future of life-changing
                        innovation and driving positive change for the benefit of society. Mr. Marcus has guided Alexandria’s
                        extraordinary growth through the tremendous execution of its visionary cluster campus strategy as
                        informed by Harvard Business Professor Michael Porter’s cluster theory. Utilizing this theory as the basis
                        for its proven cluster model that identified and brings together the four critical components necessary for
                        life science companies to thrive — location, innovation, talent, and capital — Mr. Marcus led pivotal shifts
                        from Alexandria’s original, single assets to amenitized cluster campuses to today’s mega campuses
                        consisting of more than 1 million RSF in both urban and suburban locations. Extending the company’s
                        impact beyond its essential Labspace ® real estate, Mr. Marcus established three additional and
                        complementary vertical platforms to enhance its holistic business model encompassing real estate,
                        venture investments, thought leadership, and corporate responsibility. Through the company’s
                        differentiated cluster-building approach, which leverages these cohesive platforms and its mega campus
                        strategy, Alexandria catalyzes the vibrant life science ecosystems it has created and cultivated in key
                        locations, including Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle,
                        Maryland, and Research Triangle, to accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries into new
                        treatments and cures.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        During Mr. Marcus’s 27 years at Alexandria as a pioneer, entrepreneur, executive, and venture capitalist,
                        he has helped form, build, and nurture a broad range of life science companies. Mr. Marcus founded and
                        continues to lead Alexandria Venture Investments, the company’s strategic venture capital platform.
                        Since its inception in 1996, it has invested in promising seed-, early-, and growth-stage companies and
                        been an integral component of the company’s multifaceted business model. As a testament to
                        Alexandria’s position at the cutting edge of innovation at the earliest stages, Alexandria Venture
                        Investments has been recognized by Silicon Valley Bank as the #1 most active corporate investor in
                        biopharma by new deal volume for four consecutive years and by AgFunder as one of the five most active
                        U.S. investors in agtech in 2020. With more than $1.6 billion under management, Alexandria Venture
                        Investments continues to invest in many of the most transformative companies accelerating breakthroughs in immunology, neuroscience, cell and gene therapies, single-cell genomics, epigenetics,
                        synthetic biology, in silico drug discovery, and other new areas of science. Mr. Marcus represents
                        Alexandria on the boards of the publicly traded Applied Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Frequency
                        Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:FREQ), Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITCI), and MeiraGTx
                        Holdings plc (NASDAQ:MGTX).
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        A trusted and collaborative partner within the life science industry, Mr. Marcus was one of the principal
                        architects of Kirin-Amgen, Inc., the trailblazing biotech joint venture established in 1984 to fund the global
                        development and commercialization of EPO (Epogen), and later G-CSF (Neupogen) — two blockbuster
                        recombinant DNA products that have meaningfully benefited countless chronic kidney disease and
                        cancer patients. In 2011, he co-founded Alexandria’s thought leadership vertical with its signature
                        initiative, the Alexandria Summit ® . Established to serve as a highly collaborative, neutral platform, the
                        Alexandria Summit convenes a diverse group of visionary stakeholders to explore critical fields in
                        healthcare and the crucial role of medical innovation in the advancement of human health, and leverages
                        its powerful collective voice to foster impactful collaborations and shape policy. Over the last decade, the
                        Alexandria Summit has helped stimulate novel approaches to disease that improve patient outcomes,
                        drive the discovery and development of novel and cost-effective therapies, impact policy to advance
                        innovation that saves lives and manages and cures disease, and address the urgent need to transform
                        our healthcare system.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        For Alexandria’s far-reaching social responsibility platform, Mr. Marcus has aimed to drive forward
                        disruptive and scalable solutions that address society’s most urgent and widespread challenges, including
                        the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid epidemic, homelessness crisis, hunger and food insecurity,
                        educational disparities, and climate change. Determined to reverse the trajectory of the opioid crisis, one
                        of the greatest U.S. public health crises, Mr. Marcus and Alexandria partnered with Verily to pioneer
                        OneFifteen, an innovative, non-profit evidence-based recovery ecosystem dedicated to helping people
                        live healthy, addiction-free lives. Alexandria led the design and development of OneFifteen’s fully
                        integrated campus that provides the full continuum of care with facilities and services for treatment,
                        residential housing, peer support, family reunification, workforce development, job placement, and
                        community transition. This meaningful endeavor was featured as the cover story in the January/February
                        2021 issue of REIT Magazine. He has also been deeply engaged with a number of highly impactful local
                        and national non-profit organizations for many years, serving on the board of directors of Robin Hood,
                        New York City’s largest poverty-fighting organization; the Emily Krzyzewski Center, which paves a path to
                        long-term success in higher education and beyond for academically focused, low-income K–12 students;
                        and the Navy SEAL Foundation, which provides vital support and care for the Naval Special Warfare
                        community and their families. Mr. Marcus also serves on the boards of the Foundation for the National
                        Institutes of Health (FNIH), the National Medal of Honor Museum, the Navy SEAL Foundation, the Parker
                        Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum. His significant philanthropic

                        prestigious Navy SEAL Foundation Patriot Award for their tireless dedication to, and embodiment of, the
                        values that epitomize the SEAL community.
